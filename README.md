Answers to Part 2:

1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

No, because testing the message feature itself would be difficult. It would not be a straightforward process to write a unit test to test the entire feature of having a user writing and sending a message and making sure another user gets it. However specific functions of the message feature, such as making sure the message is valid for example, could be tested. 

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

Yes, this would be more straightforward as we could write a test checking the length of the message sent. If it's longer than 80 characters, an error would be sent.
